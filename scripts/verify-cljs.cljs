;; Not a formality: this codec does BCD nibble packing and bitmap
;; construction with `bit-shift-left`/`bit-and`/`unsigned-bit-shift-right`
;; throughout, and JavaScript's bitwise operators are 32-bit and signed
;; where the JVM's are 64-bit. A byte value never leaves the 0..255 range
;; here, which is safe from that divergence, but asserting it on both
;; runtimes is cheaper than assuming it -- see org-modbus's own copy of
;; this script for a case in this workspace where the assumption was wrong.
